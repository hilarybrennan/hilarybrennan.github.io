<h2>Inaugural Post, setting up the blog</h2>


<h3> Introduction</h3>
We had lasagna for lunch today, so I of course too the post-lunch lull as an oppportunity to do not work at work and set this guy up.

The purpose of the blog is three-fold:

1. To have a web resence that is not controlled by a corporation, aggressivly mined by a data-aggregator, or easily accessible to people with whom I attended high school.
2. To join the robust community of programmers, developers, and other shapers of digital nature who believe in contributing to a central, free codebase and source of knowledge about computing.
3. To make visible the experience of being a woman in a male-dominated world, and to serve as an access point to other female developers who are stuck as to how to proceed.
